1.  Indentation size is 4 spaces, or a tab. The outmost functions and classes should align with the
    leftmost column.
    
2.  Comments at the start of a function or class should be written like this:
    /**
     * This is a comment.
     */
    Comments inside a function or class should be written like this:
    // This is a comment.
    // It spans 2 lines.

3.  The length of a line is unlimited, which means a very long statement does not need to split into multiple lines.
    We can use "word wrap" functionality provided by text editors to read long statements more easily.

4.  To improve the readability, spaces are used in the following way:
    --- There are no spaces after function names.
    --- Commas have a space after them.
    --- There are no spaces after `(' or `[' or preceding `]' or `)' characters.
        error = function(a1, a2);
        if (error != 0)
            exit(error);
    --- Unary operators do not require spaces, but binary operators do.
        a = b->c[0] + ~d == (e || f) || g && h ? i : j >> 1;
    --- There is a space after keywords (if, while, for, return, switch).

5.  Variables are named in Java style, i.e. nameMeLikeThis, not Python style, i.e. do_not_name_me_like_this.

6.  Opening braces go on the same line as the keyword (if, else, while, for, switch, or function definition).
    Do NOT put it on a line by itself.
